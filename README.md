## ⏱️ Time Tracker Google extension using 📈 Google Sheets as data storage written in ⚛️ React

## Features

- Google Sheet as a backend
  - Privacy and access control
- Materil UI

## Getting started (WIP)

1. Make a copy of [Detonate - Time Tracking Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aPo1wlEXueb6poGt7X3XjYVy-VPDaGJhOO5pNBMdl48/edit?usp=sharing) to your drive `File -> Make a copy...`
2. Note the **id** of your new sheet (it's part of the URL)
3. Create a new sheet and take a note of the **title**
4. Clone, install dependencies and build the app
5. WIP

### Sharing

Adding another person (for example your partner) to the app is easy – you just give them access to the detonate sheet in Google Sheets.

After that, they have the same access as you are and can traking the time in the projects through the same URL.
